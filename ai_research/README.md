## Current Research

### AI Provider Analysis
- Multi-provider comparison (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, XAI)
- Cost analysis and token efficiency
- Latency and performance characteristics
- Feature capabilities matrix

### UI/UX Research
- AI Elements component analysis
- 48+ components available for AI-powered UI
- Integration patterns and best practices
- Performance implications

### Architecture Evaluations
- Streaming vs. non-streaming API responses
- Event-based architecture benefits
- Server-side vs. client-side AI integration
- Caching strategies for AI responses

## Experimental Findings

### ✅ Validated Approaches

1. **Multi-Provider Architecture**
   - Conclusion: Successfully enables provider switching
   - Benefit: Flexibility for cost optimization
   - Status: Production-ready

2. **Distributed Service Layer**
   - Conclusion: Better maintainability than monolithic
   - Benefit: Easier to extend with new providers
   - Status: Recently refactored and validated

3. **Event Streaming for Real-time Updates**
   - Conclusion: Works well for live UI updates
   - Benefit: Better UX for long-running operations
   - Status: Production-ready

### ⚠️ Areas for Further Research

- [ ] Rate limiting strategies
- [ ] Cost optimization for high-volume usage
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Multi-modal AI integration (image, audio, video)

## Guidelines

When adding research:
1. Date your entries (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Include hypothesis and methodology
3. Document findings and conclusions
4. Include relevant metrics and data
5. Link to related documents
6. Note if findings have been implemented
