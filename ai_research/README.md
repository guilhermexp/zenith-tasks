# AI Research & Experiments

Research notes, proof of concepts, technology evaluations, and experimental features for Zenith Tasks.

## Purpose
This directory contains explorations, experiments, technology research, and findings that may or may not be incorporated into the main codebase.

## Files Organization
- **Technology Evaluations** - Assessment of libraries and tools
- **Proof of Concepts** - POC implementations and experiments
- **Performance Benchmarks** - Performance analysis and optimization research
- **Experimental Features** - Features under development or testing
- **Research Findings** - Conclusions and recommendations

## Categories

### Technology Research
- Evaluations of new libraries or frameworks
- Comparison of alternatives
- Integration feasibility studies

### Performance Analysis
- Benchmark results
- Optimization opportunities
- Load testing results

### Experimental Features
- POC implementations
- Feature explorations
- Integration experiments

### Best Practices
- Patterns discovered during development
- Lessons learned
- Recommendations for future work

## Current Documentation
No research documents yet. This directory is ready for ongoing exploration.

## Last Updated
November 3, 2025

## Guidelines for New Research
1. Clearly mark experiments and POCs
2. Include conclusions and recommendations
3. Reference related issues or features
4. Date entries for tracking progress
5. Archive outdated findings
6. Cross-reference with main documentation when findings are incorporated

## Integration with Main Codebase
When research finds a solution:
1. Document the finding in this directory
2. Move implementation to appropriate code location
3. Update ai_docs/ with the integrated solution
4. Reference the research in related documentation
